##JavaScript Hoisting

###JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted
In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used. In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.
To understand this, you have to understand the term "hoisting".   
__Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function).__
